The dataset represents operational data from a Call Center Queue System, capturing key metrics that reflect customer service performance. Each record corresponds to a single customer call handled by the call center.
The dataset includes five primary attributes:
•	Call ID: A unique identifier assigned to each incoming call.
•	Arrival Time: The time at which the customer’s call entered the system. This helps to ana-lyze call patterns and peak hours.
•	Service Time: The total time an agent spent attending to the customer, indicating how long the call took to resolve.
•	Wait Time: The duration the customer waited before being connected to an agent. High wait times may suggest system congestion or insufficient staffing.
•	Status: The final state of the call (e.g., Answered or Missed), providing insights into service success and missed opportunities.
This dataset is ideal for evaluating queue performance, customer experience and agent efficiency. It allows for modeling metrics such as average waiting time, throughput, service utilization and bottle-necks in the call handling process.
The call center dataset provides a clear view of how efficiently incoming customer requests are being handled. By analyzing patterns in arrival, service, and waiting times, one can identify performance gaps and opportunities for optimization.
The dataset supports the development of models to:
•	Detect peak demand periods where additional staffing may be required.
•	Measure service efficiency through average service times and variance.
•	Improve customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and missed calls.
Overall, this dataset serves as a reliable foundation for studying queue dynamics, resource 
allocation and system performance optimization in a real-world service environment.
